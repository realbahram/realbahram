# Hi there, I'm Bahram! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Cloud Engineer and Software Developer with a passion for building scalable, secure, and innovative solutions. With a Masterâ€™s in Information Technology and a background in Computer Engineering, Iâ€™ve spent the last 4+ years diving deep into cloud computing, DevOps, and data analytics.

I used to think technology was all about hardware and physical systemsâ€”thatâ€™s why I started with Computer Engineering. But I soon realized the endless possibilities of the virtual world: the cloud, software, and data. This realization sparked my transition into cloud computing and software development, where Iâ€™ve been able to combine my technical expertise with my love for problem-solving and innovation.

Today, Iâ€™m focused on AWS cloud solutions, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and serverless architectures. I believe the cloud is the foundation of modern technologyâ€”a platform that enables innovation, scalability, and efficiency. Itâ€™s a space where I see myself growing, learning, and contributing for years to come.

## What Iâ€™m Working On:
Iâ€™m currently building hands-on projects to showcase my skills and share my knowledge. Here are a few highlights:

**3-Tier Infrastructure on AWS with Terraform**: Designed and deployed a scalable, secure cloud architecture using Terraform.

**Dynamic Web Application on AWS**: Automated cloud resource provisioning with Terraform, Docker, and ECS.

**Product Sales Data Analysis**: Created interactive dashboards with Power BI to visualize trends and insights.

Iâ€™m also passionate about AI and large language models, having worked on research projects analyzing AI-generated responses using Python and SQL.

# What I Bring to the Table:
Cloud Expertise: AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, DynamoDB), Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform.

**Programming**: Python, Java, JavaScript, C++.

**Databases**: SQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.

**DevOps**: CI/CD pipelines, Agile methodologies, Git/GitHub.

**Certifications**: [AWS Certified Developer Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/c6efea2c-029a-4a72-86b8-70d4e17e7add/public_url), [AWS Solutions Architect Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/2a5a49f7-891f-4788-a052-7e74ad22d388/public_url), [HashiCorp Terraform Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/c3f8aba6-245f-46c2-9c81-436060dfa46a/public_url).

# Why I Do What I Do:
I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems. Whether itâ€™s optimizing systems, analyzing data, or building scalable applications, Iâ€™m driven by the challenge of creating efficient and impactful solutions.
